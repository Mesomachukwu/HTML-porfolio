<h1>Best K-drama According To Mimi</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 K-drama series</h2>
<h3>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</h3>
<p>This series was just something different. Its about disability, particularly autism, and just a bit on romance.</p>
<h3>Vicenzo</h3>
<p>This is majorly about revenge and how it was executed. If you love revenge plot, i recommend 'The Glory'.</p>
<h3>Reborn Rich</h3>
<p>This is another revenge series. Its mainly about a guy that was reborn into the family that killed him. It has a bit of romance, well if you dont like romance I'll still recommend watching it because the romance is very little.</p>
